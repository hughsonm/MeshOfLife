# MeshOfLife
Conway's Game of Life is a 2D, grid-based cellular automaton.
MeshOfLife applies that idea to a 3d, tetrahedral-mesh structure, and runs simulations in parallel using MPI.
Nodes in the mesh can have a variable number of neighbours, and the simulation domain is inherently bounded. These features allow for interesting behaviour.
